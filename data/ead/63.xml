Burrows on December 18, 1910 in New York City to Louis and Julia Burrows. His father was in the paint and wallpaper business. He graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and attended City College and New York University first in a pre-med program and then studying accounting. In 1931 he was hired by a brokerage firm on Wall Street where he worked for three years. He then worked in his father's paint business and as a traveling salesman for a maple syrup firm. During summers he was a popular entertainer in the Catskills and found he enjoyed making a living with his humor.</p> <p>Burrows began selling radio sketches in 1938 and for four years was a writer for Ed Gardner's <title>Duffy's Tavern</title>, <date>1941-1945</date>. He also wrote pieces for <title>CBS Texaco Theater</title>, <title>The Joan Davis Show</title>, and <title>The Ford Program</title>. In Hollywood he became a hit at exclusive parties with his satirical songs and recitations with titles such as <title>The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes</title> and <title>I'm Walking down Memory Lane without a Single Thing to Remember</title>. During the course of his career, he appeared on many radio and TV programs, recorded two albums of songs and published <title>An Abe Burrows Songbook</title>. In 1948 and 1949 he toured the country performing in nightclubs and also had his own radio shows: <title>The Abe Burrows Show</title> and <title>Breakfast with Burrows</title> .</p> <p>Burrows' biggest hits, however, were in the world of musical theater. At CBS in Hollywood he had worked for Ernest Martin who later joined with Cy Feuer to produce <title>Guys and Dolls</title>. It was Martin who brought Burrows to work on the Broadway show. The <title>Guys and Dolls</title> that opened in November 1950 with book and lyrics by Burrows and music by Frank Loesser, was an award-winning production and major hit that ran for years and was revived in London, on Broadway and on school stages around the country. Burrows' other major hit, again with Frank Loesser, was <title>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</title>which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in <date>1962</date>.</p> <p>From <date>1950</date> on Burrows' work was primarily for the Broadway stage as writer, director or both.

In <date>1952</date> he was writer and director for <title>Three Wishes for Jamie</title> which he adapted with Charles O'Neal, in <date>1953</date> he wrote and directed <title>Can-Can</title>, and in <date>1954</date> he directed <title>Reclining Figure</title>. He adapted the screenplay of <title>Ninotchka</title> for the Cole Porter musical <title>Silk Stockings</title> and wrote the screenplay for <title>Solid Gold Cadillac</title>in <date>1955</date> and collaborated with Harry Kurnitz on <title>Once More with Feeling</title> in <date>1957</date> and with Richard and Marion Bissell on <title>Say, Darling</title>which he also directed in <date>1958</date>. He was also writer and director for <title>First Impressions</title>, an adaptation of <title>Pride and Prejudice</title> and director of <title>Golden Fleecing</title> in <date>1959</date>, for <title>Cactus Flower</title>, <date>1965</date>, for <title>Holly Golightly</title>, <date>1966</date>, a musical theater remake of the film <title>Breakfast at Tiffany's</title>which closed before its Broadway opening, and for <title>Four on a Garden</title>, <date>1971</date> . His other directing credits include <title>Happy Hunting</title>, <title>Golden Fleecing</title>, <title>What Makes Sammy Run?</title>, <title> Forty Carats</title>, and <title>No Hard Feelings</title>. He was a director for <title>Good News</title>, <date>1974</date> and co-writer and director for <title>Hellzapoppin'</title>, <date>1976</date>, but left both shows before their openings. He also did some directing work on the show <title>Forty-Second Street</title> in <date>1981</date>.</p> <p>Burrows married his first wife Ruth in 1936. The couple had two children: James born in 1940 and Laurie in 1944, and were divorced in 1948. He married Carin Smith on October 2, 1950.

Folders are for individual correspondent for prominent and/or prolific writers, followed by miscellaneous groupings for each letter of the alphabet. The letters range from substantive correspondence with colleagues such as Harry Kurnitz, Frank Loesser and Cole Porter, to extensive correspondence on arrangements and complaints with car rental agencies and department stores. Burrows was an inveterate letter writer and his many correspondents included Fred Allen, Steve Allen, Woody Allen, Mac Benoff, Richard Bissell, Bernard Braden, Art Buchwald, Eddie Cantor, Noel Coward, Fleur Cowles, Bing Crosby, Robert Emmet Dolan, Cy Feuer, Pierre Galante, Ed Gardner, Oscar Hammerstein, Julie Harris, Moss Hart, Lester Hyman, Belinda Jelliffe, Nunnally Johnson, E.

This sub-series also includes correspondence with professional organizations such as the Dramatists Guild.</p> <p> In 1951 Burrows was subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and attempted to cooperate by testifying. He was not charged or blacklisted though in 1954 he still experienced some problems with potential sponsors because of the fact that he had been subpoenaed. His testimony, later statements, correspondence with his lawyers and letters he received from the public are filed here under "HUAC".</p></scopecontent><c03 level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence
